BayouGuru's online conky repository

This repository contains all of the currently active conkys on BayouGuru's main system.  There are 3 conkys and 3 lua scripts as follows:

"l-conky-cpu.conf" - The CPU section conky.  Displays the CPU Core and Average usage, GPU Usage, GPU Core and Memory frequencies. This conky is aligned to the top-left corner andupdates every .5 second.

"l-conky-sysinfo.conf" - The System Informaton conky, which gives Uptime, Toggleable keys, Update, Connected devices, RAM, SSD and Swap information.  This conky aligns on the left side just under the CPU/GPU conky.

"rightconky.conf" - This conky monitors all network activity and provides network connectivity and system file versioning information.

"conkycpubars.lua" - The Lua script which is responsible for rendering the cool 3-D-looking segmented LED bars and round glowy LED's in the CPU conky.  You will need to edit this file as-needed for the particulars of your hardware setup.  These bars use a linear scale.

"sysbars.lua" - The Lua script which is responsible for rendering the cool 3-D-looking segmented LED bars in the conky.  This also draws the round "LED indictors", and the threshold data is located in the table at the end of the lua.  You will need to edit this file as-needed for the particulars of your hardware setup.  These bars use a linear scale.

"updownbars.lua" - The Lua script which is responsible for rendering the cool looking segmented LED bars in the Network (right) conky.  You will need to edit this file as-needed for the particulars of your hardware setup.  This lua uses a loarithmic scale for the bar so as to make it more reactive at the slower upload/download speeds that most data transfers happen. This mimics the scaling of audio equipment V/U meters, which also use this scaling method for the same reasons I am using it here, which is ti make it more reactive overall than a simple linear-scaled bar, which is what is used in all of the other luas here. 

"rightconky.conf" - The right-top/side conky, which displays the system's network information, the top 5 processes using CPU and RAM and up to 6 inbound and/or up to 18 outbound network connections (minus the number of inbound connections) are shown. It also features the lua LED upload and download bars to show bandwidth usage.  I think the only thing necessary to edit in this config if you are going to leech it is the network adapter name.  The search string to replace with your adapter's name is "enp6s0", which appears 6 times in the config.  The size and total number of connections can be expanded to suit higher resolution displays simply by extending the logical structure of the bottom section which contains the code that lists the connections.  By doing this, you could make it show more incoming and/or more outbound connections on monitors with more real estate to play with, such as 2k, 4k and 8k displays.  In pont of fact, if you don't mind taskbar occlusion, you could add 2 more connections to the 1080 display before running out of vertical space, but I wanted to keep it clear of the taskbar, even if the conky's background is going "full-screen" vertically.  The DE's taskbar displays over the bottom of the conky, not under, but it doesn't hurt anything.  I found it annoying/distracting to see the flicker of the redraw when resizing the conky for fewer connections, so setting the minimum height for 1076 pixelsseems to eliminate all those problems.

These conky configurations are posted here for you to modify and use as you please.  I make no warranty as to their functionality on any system other than my own, as it is a certainty that you WILL need to edit these configurations in order to tailor them to the particulars of your system.  This is especially true of the temerature data, which can change locations simply by connecting another device to your system.  These conkys are the result of months of very intense work refining and tweaking the configurations to fit my use-case.  If you find it useful, then I am glad.  If you have questions, please feel free to ask me!

  Credit for the Lua scripts goes to Reddit user u/DareBoy58 who shared his version of the script which I have now heavily-edited to suit my system and purposes.  Bear in mind that you MUST be running a conky-all or conky-lua build with all 4 of the Lua extensions enabled in the compiler in order to use these conkys! Credit for the lua scripts also goes to ChatGPT initially, and lately I have migrated to the better-performing GitHub Copilot AI, which has been heavily-relied-upon to make this code as simple and efficient as I can make it.  As an example, the CPU usage of the system info conky has dropped from ~2.5% down to ~1.4% over the last couple of weeks.
