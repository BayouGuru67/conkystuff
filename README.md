BayouGuru's online conky repository

This repository contains all of the currently active conkys on BayouGuru's main system.  There are three conkys.  
"conky.conf" - The main conky, which displays the main system information such as the temperatures, disk space usage, cpu & ram usage and resides at the left-top of the screen, 

"weatherconky.conf" - The weather conky, which lives at the bottom-left of the screen, parses the AccuWeather RSS feed.

"rightconky.conf" - The right-top conky, which displays the system's  network information, the top 5 users of CPU and ram, up to 6 inbound and up to 12 outbound network connections, reszing as-needed.

These conky configurations are posted here for you to modify and use as you please.  I make no warranty as to their functionality on any system other than my own, as it is a certainty that you WILL need to edit these configurations in order to tailor them to the particulars of your system.  This is especially true of the temerature data, which can change locations simply by connecting another device to your system.  These conkys are the result of months of very intense work refining and tweaking the configurations to fit my use-case.  If you find it useful, then I am glad.  If you have questions, please feel free to ask me!
